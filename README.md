# Warm-Magnetized-Plasma-Dispersion-Relation
Solving the Dispersion Relation in Warm Magnetized Plasma with Propagation at an angle theta to the magnetic field.

The file plasma1.m contains a program to plot the refractive index relative to angle theta, while plasma2.m contains a program to plot the refractive index n relative to temperature.
